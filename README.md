## :rocket: Welcome to ClassServer!

**ClassServer** is an IoT-powered gaming system designed for classroom fun and learning. Hosted at `https://github.com/1ELER-24-25/ClassServer`, it transforms physical games like chess (and soon foosball!) into a digital experience with real-time tracking, ELO rankings, and a slick web interface. Built for students and teachers at **1ELER-24-25**, it‚Äôs a work in progress‚Äîand we‚Äôre excited to see it grow!

> :warning: **Note**: This project is under active development. Features are being added, bugs are being squashed, and awesomeness is being crafted! Check back often for updates.
